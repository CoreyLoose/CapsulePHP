What's the point?

Frequently I'd find myself arguing that the best framework would be one that did nothing Ñ although this is a bit of an exaggeration I decided to see how close I could get to this ideal. Less of a framework and more of a skeleton.rovide the bones and make it easy to strap in the muscles and nerves.

What do I need?

Capsule requires PHP 5.3 and was constructed with Apache and MySQL in mind. It has a leaning towards mid to large size web apps but with a trick or two it will run nicely in a shared-hosting environment.
